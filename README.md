# Project Express API

To build a RESTful API with node.js, containing endpoints giving arrays and unique objects. Deployment in Heroku.

## The problem

Started out to build a couple of endpoints with PAF params. When that was solved I continued to apply endpoints with query. Lastly making a definition of routes i the landing page. I built it in small steps to be able to troubleshoot every new endpoint. I used both console and Postman to check my API. If I had more time I would definitely try build a frontend with sorting structure.
